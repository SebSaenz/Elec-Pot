## Module 2: Power Transistor

Power transistors offer controlled switching capabilities (both turn-on and turn-off) and operate in the saturation region as switching elements, providing low on-state voltage drops. They feature much faster switching speeds compared to thyristors and are widely used in DC-DC and DC-AC converters, typically paired with inverse parallel-connected diodes for bidirectional current flow.

-Junction field-effect transistors (JFETs)

-Metal oxide silicon field-effect transistors (MOSFETs)

-Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs)

MOSFETs, BJTs, IGBTs can be assumed as ideal switches to explain the power conversion techniques. A transistor can be operated as a switch.
However, the choice between a BJT and an MOSFET in the converter circuits is not obvious, but each of them can replace a switch, provided that its voltage and current ratings meet the output requirements of the converter.
